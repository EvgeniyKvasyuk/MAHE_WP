> "Project should looks like it was written by one person"

_Wise samurai_

**Some rules from this code styles are covered by linters, but it isn`t bad to read it one more time**

**All of these rules can be changed if we will decide that it have to be done.** 

# 1. Common rules

## 1.1. Common code

It is required to reuse existing code maximally. If you find some code necessary for your functional in other part of
application you must make refactoring and move such functional to `common`. If some code exists in `common` you have to 
use it. BUT! You should strongly understand that this code is  "common" and won`t be changed for particular business
requirements and won't become more branching.

## 1.2.

We use space for formatting. And only spaces.

Tabs change for space: 1 tab = 2 space

Required length of string is no more than 120 symbols. You should follow next rules for it:

* no more 2 arguments in function. If you want more, use object.
* You should move to next string properties of object or elements of array if there are more than one.
* You should move to move body of arrow function to the next string if it isn't in call of component or other function.

It is recommended to split logic blocks of code by empty line.

You have to use ';' where it is needed.

## 1.3. Naming of variables, methods, classes, modules, files.

__Module__ is always named with `camelCase` if it exports object and with PascaleCase if it exports constructor.
__Class__ is always named with `PascaleCase`
__Method/function__ is always named with `camelCase`. Starting with `verb`. 

It is recommended to follow this naming approach when naming handler methods:

`<SomeComponent onClick={handleClick} />`

That is, method should be named with start of `on` and handler function for such method should be named with start of `handler`

Imported _variable_ is named as Module with `camelCase` if it is object, or primitive; and with `PascaleCase` if constructor is in this variable.

_React_ Component is named with `PascaleCase`. You shouldn't use suffix `Component` (`Item`, but no `ItemComponent`).

If file of component is exporting outside of Module you should add name of parent component or module as prefix.

Root Component of Module should be exported with the name of the module.

```javascript
/*
modules/
  - Users/
    - components
      - List.js
      - Item.js 
    - index.js
    - Users.js
*/

// content modules/Users/components/Item.js
/* ... */
export { Item };

// content modules/Users/components/List.js
/* ... */
export { List };

// content modules/Users/Users.js
/* ... */
export { Users };

// content modules/Users/index.js
export { Item as UsersItem } from '.components/Item';
export { List as UsersList } from '.components/List';
export { Users } from './Users';
```

When using some abbreviations in the name of variables, methods etc., only first letter is in uppercase.

Using of `let` and `const` is required. Use `var` only in exceptional cases.

Declare `objects` and `arrays` only with short syntax.  

```js
// Badly
const item = new Object();
const arr = new Array();

// Good
const item = {};
const arr = [];
```

If file exports *single* entity the name of file should be equal the name of this entity. If there are few entities inside
of file the name should be equal of type of this entities.

**Example**

`useSomething.ts` - if there is a `useSomething` hook inside and `hooks.ts` if there are several hooks inside.

## 1.4. Comments in code

In general, sending commented code to the repository is highly undesirable. It is allowed to leave comments:

* important warnings, for example, as a result of a bug fix;
* Description of the agreement, if the implementation looks non-obvious;
* code that is temporarily disabled for reasons beyond the control of the frontend;
* a description of a known flaw, marked with the words TODO or FIXME, be sure to include your last name in TODO
in the format ```\\TODO-Surname```
* in mocks - unused stubs (or parts) of responses, provided that they are relevant in response format

Start your comment with a space. Write comments *only in English*

## 1.5 Repository of source code (Git)

### 1.5.1 Branches naming rules

`<type>/<intitials>/<taskname><-description(optional)>`

**type**:
* feature - development of new functionality (new page, new button, new input field, etc.).
* fix - fixing defects.
* docs - change in the documentation.
* refactor - implementation changes while maintaining the current functionality.
* test - adding/changing tests. No impact on production code.
* chore - update in the assembly mechanism. No impact on production code.

**initials**: your initials that uniquely identify you in the project: `nlastname`, `firstnamelastname`, etc.

**taskname**: Jira issue number in the format "MHWP-000".

Example: `feature/ekvasiuk/JIRATASK-001`

### 1.5.2 Commit messages rules

`<type>: [JIRATASK-000]<subject>`

The commit message should be concise and reflect the essence of the changes made. It is preferable to also indicate the module in which the change was made.

**Adding a VALID entity from JIRA to the commit message is mandatory!**

**type:**

* feature - development of new functionality (new page, new button, new input field, etc.).
* fix - fixing defects.
* docs - change in the documentation.
* refactor - implementation changes while maintaining the current functionality.
* test - adding/changing tests. No impact on production code.
* chore - update in the assembly mechanism. No impact on production code.

**Examples:**

`fix: [WEBCORE2-0000] fixing missspelling in Icon`
`fix: [WEBCORE1-0000] Activity history - date picker fix`
`feature: [WEBCORE2-0000] Added article page`

**Examples of bad commit messages:**

`fix: [TT-111] Fix for release`
`feat: [GG-1] New Page`

# 2. JavaScript

## 2.1 Index file

Used only for imports to and exports from it. It should not contain any other code.
`src/common/SomeFolder/index.ts`, where there is some code in the index and this is the only file of the folder, it is preferable to replace it with
`src/common/SomeFolder.ts` where this code will be placed. This is true for any level of nesting.
The index file is always accessed as a file, not a directory.

**Good:**

`import { something } from './src/common/whatever' - // this is a file access `

**Badly:**

`import { something } from './src/common/whatever/' - // this is a reference to the directory in which there is an index file `

## 2.2 export

We try to avoid using `default export` unless we plan to use `import()` exported via dynamic import

## 2.3 Modules

A description of the structure and rules for generating a module can be found in `wiki\modules.md`

### 2.3.1 Import sequence

We separate each of the categories into a separate block with an empty line after

1) Named imports from `node_modules`

```javascript
import noop from 'lodash/noop';
```

2) **Non-named imports from `node_modules` (rare case)

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/style.css';
```

3) Named absolute imports

```javascript
import module from 'js/module';
```

4) Absolute **not**named imports (rare case)

```javascript
import 'css/style.css';
```

5) Relative named imports.
On your consideration: the "further" the imported file is from the source one, the higher the import in the list.

```javascript
import CONST from '../constant';
```

7) Relative **not**named imports

```javascript
import './style.css';
```

*Note that the order of imports is monitored by a linter*

## 2.4 Localised string

String values that are used in components are stored in the `locale.ts` file as `const locale`, which is an object. Such a file should be in every module.

**Example**

file locale.ts

```javascript
  export const locale = {
  someText: 'Text is used in the components'
};
```

Using of locale SomeComponents.ts

```javascript
import { locale } from '../locale';

const SomeComponents = () => {
  return <div>{locale.someText}</div>
};
```

## 2.5. Cast

For boolean conditions that check for the existence of a variable, use `Boolean(anyVariable)` (preferred) or `!!anyVariable`. In JSX, it is necessary to boolean expressions that should not be rendered (for example, a block render condition).

## 2.6. Constants

Module-level constants ("magic numbers", string constants, parameters, etc.) must be declared with `const`` and named in UPPER_CASE with an underscore, for example:

```js
const FORMATTING_OPTIONS_AMOUNT = {
  thousandsSeparator: true,
  maxTwoDecimal: true,
  allowMinus: false,
};
```

Naming in UPPER_CASE does not apply to functions, as well as constants that depend on other variables.
An entity name of a reference type is named in uppercase if it is immutable. The fields of such an entity are **always** named in lower case.

## 2.7. Functions

The use of "arrow functions" is encouraged where possible. Use "arrow functions" instead of keeping the context (`let self = this`).

When  **possible**, use shorthand arrow functions without the `return` keyword. When using shorthand syntax, if an object must be returned, it is wrapped in parentheses so that the interpreter distinguishes it from the function body.

## 2.8. Comparisons

It is preferable to use the comparison operators `===` and `!==` rather than `==` and `!=`. The exceptions are comparisons with `null` and `undefined`.

## 2.9. Spaces and indents

Put one space before the opening curly brace.
When declaring an anonymous function with the `function` keyword, put a single space before the opening parenthesis.
Put a single space before the parenthesis in `if`.
Separate operands of binary and ternary operators (for example, `a + b`) with a space. The contents of an object written to a string must be separated from curly braces by spaces (for example, `{ a: '123' }`).
Do not include a space when calling a function.

## 2.10 ESLint

When rebuilding the project and when committing, the code is run through the ESLint analyzer. Before committing the code to the Git repository, you need to fix any problems found.
_This section is incomplete. You will help the project by correcting and supplementing it with a list of rules for ESLint._

## 2.11 logging

Before submitting, you need to make sure that all debug output instructions to the console are removed, for example, `console.debug('…');`. If you intentionally skipped logging, please leave a comment or a TODO.

## 2.12 React features

1. Preference is given to the use of functional components and hooks on the project, but it is not forbidden to use class components.
   _This section is incomplete. You will help the project by correcting and supplementing it._

### Using Hooks

1. Complex calculations are recommended to be wrapped in `useMemo`.
2. The recommended order of using a hook in a component is selector hooks (`useSelector`, `useContext`), action hooks (`useState`, `useQuery`, `useMutations`, `useDispatch`), handler hooks (`useCallback` ), effect hooks (`useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`)

## 2.13 JSX (TSX)

In one *.jsx *.tsx file it is **strictly** recommended to describe only one component, which will be exported. The only exceptions are simple components obtained via `styled`. The rest of the components are best placed in separate files.

**Example:**

```jsx
const ItemWrapper = styled.div`
  background: red
`;

export const Item = () => {
  return <ItemWrapper /> ;
}
```

**better, than**

```jsx
const ItemWrapper = styled.div`
  background: red
`;

export const Item = () => {
  return <ItemWrapper />;
}

export const OtherItem = () => {
  return <Item>OtherItem</Item> 
}

export const AndAnotherItem = () => {
  return <ItemWrapper>AnotherItem</ItemWrapper>;
}
```
## 2.14. Testing

To implement tests, use the Jest framework.
Try to do more unit tests and avoid writing integration tests that are difficult to both develop and maintain.

## 2.15. SVG to JS

It is allowed to place SVG images in JS code. This is useful when we want to avoid delays when loading an image or use the `fill` property to change the fill color. When inserting SVG, it is necessary to "run" through the SVGO optimizer and convert some tags to JSX.
When adding an image to a project, keep in mind that in the future it may be needed in a different color, and use fill instead of the stroke to paint through CSS. Designers can be asked to remake the icon "into outlines".
If the SVG has a hardcoded width/height and does not adjust to externally passed dimensions, then the "Prefer viewBox to width/height" checkbox must be selected in SVGO, which is not selected by default.

## Typechecking

We use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

All types generated by us are named in accordance with the general naming rules and coincide in name with the typed entity.

```javascript
// InfinityStone.ts
type Props = {};
type State = {};
class InfinityStone extends Component<Props, State> { /*... */ }
```
Exported types, including those used outside the file in which they are described, are suffixed with the `Type` `Interface` `Enum` suffix.
If you intend to use the same types in several places, it is best to describe them in the `types.ts` file and take them from there. Including within one module.

```javascript
// InfinityStone.ts
type Props = {};
type State = {};
export type InfinityStoneType = {};
class InfiniTyStone extends Component<Props, State> { /*... */ }
```

An interface has to be used for the description of an implementation obligation:

```javascript
interface ChatterboxInterface {
  greetNeighbour: (name: string) => string;
}

class People implements ChatterboxInterface {
  greetNeighbour = (name: string = "neighbour") => `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

A type has to be used for description of structure of entity:

```javascript
type UserType = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

function introduceUser({ name, age }: UserType) {
  return `My name is ${name}, I am ${age}`;
}
```

Try to use descriptive, rather than single-letter, names for variables in generic types where a single argument is expected.

```javascript
Component<Props, State, Return>
```

**better, than**

```javascript
Component<P, S, R>
```

To describe the types included in the props component, it is better to use the props type declaration, and not the description of the entire component as a whole

**Example**

```javascript
const YourComponent = (props: Props) => {
  ...
}
``` 

**better, than**

```javascript
const YourComponent: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {
  ...
}
```
